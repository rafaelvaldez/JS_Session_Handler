About
This session manager synchronizes activity across tabs within a browser; this allows you to donâ€™t logout a user if they remain active in a tab while inactive in others.
 This is mainly a JavaScript implementation, PHP was used as example to handle the server logic though is not my intention to provide nor suggest the shown server implementation as it was setup for example purposes.
